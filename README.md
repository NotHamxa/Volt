# Volt

**Your system, at your fingertips.**

Volt is a fast, minimal launcher for Windows — built with Electron and React. Hit a shortcut, find what you need, and get back to work.

## What it does

**Search everything**
Type to instantly search installed apps, files and folders, system commands, and Windows Settings — all from one place.

**Pin what you use most**
Right-click any app to pin it. Add links by URL. Pinned items always appear at the top.

**Watch your directories**
Tell Volt which folders to index and your files surface directly in the search bar, kept up to date automatically.

**Web search without leaving the launcher**
Press `Tab` to switch between local and web search. No need to open a browser for a quick lookup.

**Bangs**
Jump straight to a site's search with a bang shortcut — `!yt`, `!g`, `!r`, and more. Fully customisable.
